# Memory block merging benchmarking tools

First run `./gather-data.sh OUT_DIRECTORY` to run all the
futhark-benchmark programs multiple times with different settings.
**WARNING**: This takes a long time, since it runs the entire benchmark
suite with 2 different configurations.  Run `./gather-data.sh
OUT_DIRECTORY TIMEOUT_SECS` to specify a timeout for every dataset run.

Then run `./merge-data.py OUT_DIRECTORY` to gather all results in one
cleaned-up JSON file named `full.json` (is quick).  Runs below 1
millisecond are always ignored (this should maybe be higher).

At this point you can run `./summarize.py OUT_DIRECTORY` to get a
pretty-printed summary of the results in the full JSON file, and you can
run `./plot.py OUT_DIRECTORY` to get several plots for every benchmark.

See the individual files for more comments on usage and effects.


# Structure in output `full.json` from `./merge-data.py`:

This file is currently used by `summarize.py` and `plot.py`.

```
